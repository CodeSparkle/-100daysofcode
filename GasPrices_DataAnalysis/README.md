# Analysis of Fuel Prices in Brazil

This code uses the libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

I used the **Pandas** lib to read a .csv file and convert the data so I could use them to make the analysis. Then I used the **Matplotlib** combined with the **Seaborn** lib to build the graphics of the average prices of ordinary gasoline and hydrous ethanol between the years of 2004 and 2019 in Brazil, and to save them as a local file.

The dataset I used is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/matheusfreitag/gas-prices-in-brazil.
You just need to download it and put in the same directory of the .py file.
